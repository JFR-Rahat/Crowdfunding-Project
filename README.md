# Crowdfunding Project

Crowdfunding is a modern approach to raise funds for projects and business or other creating idea and incorporating it with blockchain technology provides many benefits like transparency, security and efficiency. So, we developed a software that can manage crowdfunding using Blockchain. Here one can create projects to raise funding for their startup projects, ideas and businesses. The other users of the site can fund in their preferred project and receive rewards according to the projects. The usersâ€™ funds will only be given to the project creator if the project reaches the funding goal, otherwise, the funding can be reclaimed by the users. The site owner will receive 5% of the funding when the project creator claims the funding for his successful project. The software has been developed using Ethereum, Solidity, PHP and JS making it a hybrid of centralized and decentralized system.
